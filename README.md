# Overview

I made this project to practice using my computer to write code and share it with other people. I wanted to make sure everything works right, like my code editor, Git, and GitHub.This is a really simple program that just shows the words **“Aloha World!”** on the screen when I run it.I made this so I can practice how to start a project, write some code, and upload it to GitHub .
